            <p>It is hard to know everything in the field of Information Technology all at once. It is easy to forget
            some aspects of IT that you do not need to use often. Because of this reason, IT Forums has created a system of easily linking to files in Google Drive as well as uploading files. 
            Topics are searchable and if you cannot find the answer to your search you can always create a new topic that others 
            can respond to! With IT Forums, you will always have regional, specific information at your finger tips.</p>
